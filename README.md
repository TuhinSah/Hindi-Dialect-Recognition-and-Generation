# Hindi-Dialect-Recognition-and-Generation

This project aims to distinguish between different dialects of Hindi, based on data collected from scripts of Hindi Movies.

There are 2 major components:

1. The dialect recognizer, which tags each line of dialogue with the dialect it is in
2. The part of speech tagger, which tags the parts of speech for each word, in all the dialects
